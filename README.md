# INCEPTION
---
Inception is a project I recently completed. Its main goal is to use Docker to set up containers and deploy various services from scratch, using minimal base images such as Alpine or Debian. In my case, I chose Alpine for its lightness and simplicity.

Throughout the development process, I made an effort to follow best practices, both in terms of file organization and the configuration and security of the services and containers.

## Services
### Nginx
### Wordpress
### Mariadb
