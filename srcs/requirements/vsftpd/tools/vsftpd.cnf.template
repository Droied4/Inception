# My Own vsftpd template Configuration - Droied4 
# Ref. Page 
# https://linux.die.net/man/5/vsftpd.conf

#####------GLOBAL CONFIG
# You may fully customise the login banner string:
ftpd_banner=Welcome to my FTP service.

# When "listen" directive is enabled, vsftpd runs in standalone mode and
# listens on IPv4 sockets. This directive cannot be used in conjunction
# with the listen_ipv6 directive.
listen=YES

# This directive enables listening on IPv6 sockets. To listen on IPv4 and IPv6
# sockets, you must run two copies of vsftpd with two configuration files.
# Make sure, that one of the listen options is commented !!
#listen_ipv6=YES

# Disable Daemon Mode. Default: background=YES
background=NO

# Uncomment this to allow local users to log in.
local_enable=YES

# Uncomment this to enable any form of FTP write command.
write_enable=YES

#####------PASSIVE MODE CONFIG
pasv_enable=YES
pasv_min_port=1024
pasv_max_port=1048

#####------ANONYMOUS CONFIG
# Allow anonymous FTP? (Beware - allowed by default if you comment this out).
anonymous_enable=YES
# When enabled, this prevents vsftpd from asking for an anonymous password - 
# the anonymous user will log straight in. 
no_anon_password=YES
# This option represents a directory which vsftpd will try to change into after 
# an anonymous login. Failure is silently ignored.
anon_root=/var/www/html
# If set to YES, anonymous users will be permitted to upload files under certain 
# conditions. For this to work, the option write_enable must be activated, and the 
# anonymous ftp user must have write permission on desired upload locations. This setting 
# is also required for virtual users to upload; by default, virtual users are treated with 
# anonymous (i.e. maximally restricted) privilege. 
anon_upload_enable=YES
# If set to YES, anonymous users will be permitted to create new directories under certain 
# conditions. For this to work, the option write_enable must be activated, and the anonymous 
# ftp user must have write permission on the parent directory. 
anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES

#####------GUEST CONFIG
#If enabled, all non-anonymous logins are classed as "guest" logins. A guest 
#login is remapped to the user specified in the guest_username setting. 
# Enable virtual users. Default: guest_enable=NO
guest_enable=NO

#####------CHROOT CONFG
# You may specify an explicit list of local users to chroot() to their home
# directory. If chroot_local_user is YES, then this list becomes a list of
# users to NOT chroot().
chroot_local_user=NO

# Workaround chroot check.
# See https://www.benscobie.com/fixing-500-oops-vsftpd-refusing-to-run-with-writable-root-inside-chroot/
# and http://serverfault.com/questions/362619/why-is-the-chroot-local-user-of-vsftpd-insecure
allow_writeable_chroot=YES

#####------LOGS CONFIG

xferlog_enable=YES
xferlog_file=/var/log/vsftpd/vsftpd.log

#####------PORTS CONFIG
# Enable active mode
port_enable=YES
connect_from_port_20=YES
ftp_data_port=${VSFTPD_DATA_PORT}
listen_port=${VSFTPD_PORT}

# go into a certain directory.
dirmessage_enable=YES
